# It is a Computer Graphics and Visualization(CGV) project which shows the working of Leacky Bucket Algorithm. The algorithm works similarly to the way an actual leaky bucket holds wate. The leaky bucket takes data and collects it up to a maximum capacity. Data in the bucket is only released from the bucket at a set rate and size of packet. When the bucket runs out of data, the leaking stops.
